# China and India Population and GDP Visualization
## Historical Population Comparison between India and China
This graph shows the population data of India and China from 1960 to 2020. From the 1960s until the end of the 20th century, both countries have followed similar population growth rates. During that period China has maintained a somewhat constant population advantage over India. However, as the Chinese population is aging faster this difference in population is narrowing rapidly.

## Historical GDP Comparison between India and China
This graph is a visualization of GDP data of India and China between 1960 and 2020. From 1960 to the early 1990s both countries had similar GDPs. However, since the turn of the century China's GDP has skyrocketted in comparison to India's. This is despite a decreasing population gap between the countries, as mentioned above. In 2020, China's GDP was more than 5 times that of India's.
