# China and India Population and GDP Visualization
## Historical Population Comparison between India and China
This graph shows the population data of India and China, from 1960 to 2020. From the 1960s until the end of the 20th century, both countries have followed similar population growth rates. During that period China has maintained a somewhat constant population advantage over India. However, as the Chinese population is aging faster this difference in population is narrowing rapidly.
